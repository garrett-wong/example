# Garrett Wong HW1 (fka example)
[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/garrett-wong/example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/garrett-wong/example)
Really not sure how to make this not say build unknown.

example/algs.py has implementations of quicksort and bubblesort,
including implementations that count assignments and conditionals.

example/runtime.py writes runtimes.txt, a log of runtimes for
each trial, and runtimes.R plots runtimes along with lines of fit for
expected big-O trends.

runtimes.tex is just the latex source for runtimes.pdf, which is the
assignment PDF that I emailed.
