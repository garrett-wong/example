\section*{Runtime of quicksort and bubble sort}
I ran 100 trials of quicksort and bubble sort for lists of $N$ elements randomly chosen with replacement from the range $[0, 1, \ldots, N)$ for $N = 100, 200, \ldots, 1000$. Plotted are the summed count of assignments and conditionals for each trial, as well as the linear fit for formulae $\texttt{operations} \sim N^2$ for bubble sort and $\texttt{operations} \sim N\log(N)$ for quicksort. These fits correspond to the expected big-O behavior of the two algorithms. The $\beta$ estimates for the $N$ terms for those two fits are 0.998 and 4.493, respectively.
